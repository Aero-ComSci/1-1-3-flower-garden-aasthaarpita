Our program can take in any input and it can produce the flowers the user wants along with the amount of each type of flower.

For example if we enter the prompt: "On a sunny day there are 3 pipsissewas 2 roses 1 tulip 2 sunflowers and 3 daisies"

## Tips/Things To Know
- Please refrain from using commas to separate the flowers. Please state the number and have the flower name directly behind it.
- When the program asks "Do you want to stop?", if you don't type "y" to represent "Yes", the project will continue running. You can continue giving the program prompts, and it will continuously draw flowers overlapping the previous ones until you say you want to quit the program.
